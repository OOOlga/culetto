 <h1>Essential and Desirable Selection Criteria</h1>

 

<p>The selection criteria contains "essential" and "desirable criteria". </p>
<ol>
<li>These are drawn up from the duty statement that shows the value of each skill or knowledge. </li>
<li>The applicant must address each selection criteria or the application will be discarded.</li> 
<li>Sometimes it appears that some question overlap, however, you cannot put “see above”, as many inexperienced applicants do, although it is tempting at times.</li>

<p>This is why it is so important to analyse each selection criteria and Winning Applications shows you how to do this with pages of examples.</p> 

<h6>People make the mistake of applying for positions where they do not meet the desirable selection criteria, thinking it is not important.</h6>


<p>This is primarily because the process was so time consuming that some public service departments were not attracting quality applicants from the private sector.  However, most departments within the public service still use a lot of selection criterion because this process is easier to administer, is relevant to position (why replace something that works and doesn't need fixing) and ensures  recruitment is  based on merit.</p>
<h2>What is the purpose of recruitment using selection criteria</h2>

<p>The Public Service <h3>(both State or Federal Government Departments)</h3>, Local Government, Statutory Authorities and Government funded agencies, use selection criteria to fulfill Equal Employment Opportunity principles, and it is supposed to get rid of nepotism and favouritism.  Each permanent job must be advertised, in-house, or in the paper.</p>
